	      are a style to define cryptographic properties and in particular to structure their proofs.
	        The CryptoZoo proof viewer allows you to engage with proofs interactively, find relevant information quickly, hide information
	        that isn't interesting to you at the moment and much more.

		Want to check out how it works? Here are three nice examples!
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<p>
			  <a href="sim-ind-cpa-landing.html">IND-CPA</a>: This is a warm-up example if you are not so familiar
			  with SSPs or cryptographic definitions as a whole. It shows that two security notions for
			  symmetric encryption are equivalent.
			</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p>
			  <a href="ggm-landing.html">GGM PRF-from-PRG</a>: This is a (constant-depth) version of a famous proof by
			  <a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/ggm.html">Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali (GGM)</a> who show
			  that pseudorandom generators (PRGs) imply stream ciphers, a.k.a. pseudorandom functions (PRFs),
			  by stacking PRGs in a tree-like fashion. In SSP-style fashion, the proof is very
			  short and neat (for a constant-depth tree) and thus a nice intermediate example.
			  It is also a very clean example of a <a href="#sspresources">hybrid proof</a>.			  .
			</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p>
			  <a href="yao-landing.html">Garbling Security of Yao's Protocol</a>: This is a
			  proof of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/175">Yao's famous garbling scheme</a>, 
			  which is a core building block for secure multi-party computation. This is the most advanced
			  example and involves a hybrid over the depth and width of a circuit. We visualize
			  the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1453">state-separating proof</a> of Yao's garbling scheme by Brzuska and Oechsner.

		For a nice introduction to SSPs, Lúcás Meier wrote a <a href="https://cronokirby.com/posts/2022/05/state-separable-proofs-for-the-curious-cryptographer/">overview blogpost</a> that is highly recommended.
		For a formal and rigorous introduction to SSPs you can check out the
		<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/306/20180403:132933" target="_blank">BDFKK paper</a>
		who also have a nice introduction to hybrid proofs in Appendix B.
