      <h4>Equivalence of two security notions for symmetric encryption</h4>
      <p>
      Symmetric encryption should provide confidentiality, i.e., leak no
      information about a message except for its length (since an adversary can
      infer the length of the message from the length of the ciphertext). So, an encryption
      of a message m should look like an encryption of a message consisting
      of |m| zeroes. This notion is captured by <a href="ind-cpa-def.html">indistinguishability under
      chosen plaintext attacks (IND-CPA)</a>, where the adversary chooses a message
      m and submits it to an ENC oracle which either returns an encryption of
      m or an encryption of |m| zeroes. The adversary can query the oracle
      multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
      An equally valid way of defining confidentiality is that whatever knowledge
      the adversary gets from ciphertexts, the adversary should have been able to <b>simulate</b> this 
      knowledge just given the length of the message |m|. This <b>simulation</b>-based
      definition is usually called <a href="sim-based-ind-cpa-def.html">semantic security</a> of encryption and is 
      equivalent to the aforementioned game-based IND-CPA definition of confidentiality.
    </p>
      <p>
      See	
      <a href="game-to-sim-ind-cpa-for-se.html">here</a> for an SSP-style proof.</br></br></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Often, IND-CPA security is also defined as a <b>left-or-right</b> distinguishing
        game which allows the adversary to submit
        two messages m0 and m1 of equal length and the game either encrypts the left or the right message.
        This notion is (up to a factor 2) equivalent to the aforementioned 
        real-or-zeroes formulation, because encryptions of m0 and m1 are both
        indistinguishable from encryptions of |m0|=|m1| zeroes and because
        we can choose one of the two messages to be the all-zeroes message.
